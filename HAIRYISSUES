Hairy Issues (July 2, 2007)


  TYPE MATCHING

    If you transclude certain node types (list items, table cells),
    you need to make sure they are wrapped in the appropriate tags so
    that they are valid in the transcluding document.  To do this,
    we'll need some hairy type checking.

  INTERPRETING FRAGMENT IDENTIFIERS

    Right now, we take a "purple numbers" view of the world.  In other
    words, if you have:

        <h2><a name="nid2" />Hairy Issues</h2>

        <p>Sasquatch.</p>

    and transcluded:

        <div href="hairy.html#nid2"></div>

    you would get:

        <h2><a name="nid2" />Hairy Issues</h2>

    You might actually want the whole section starting with the
    header.  How would you do that in XPath?  What's the right
    default?

  FINER GRANULARITY

    We'd really like folks to be able to highlight a section of a Web
    page, then transclude that content.  When we do this, we'll run
    into range issues -- transcluding sections of content without end
    tags, for example.  These are all things that Ted Nelson points
    out in his essay, "Embedded Markup Considered Harmful."  We can
    handle it, but it will be hairy.

  XHTML ISSUES ON SOME BROWSERS

	In Internet Explorer, if you transclude some remote content that
	is XHTML, such as <a name="foobar"/>, IE will not be able to 
	parse the content because there is no space before the /> since
	it does not understand XHTML. The hosted inclusion service
	could normalize this XHTML with a space before it.
