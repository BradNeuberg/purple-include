To Do (December 25th, 2007)

  * Consolidate not using two XML parsers (Xerces and Saxon)

  * Write quote() unit tests

  * When I push Purple Include to my web server, large documents like the HTML 5 spec become
	slow or unreliable, while locally they are fine; what is up? We need to do some performance
	testing.
	
  * I left in lots of commented out System.out.println's since I am still testing the
  QuoteAddress -- clean up once done.

  * Update docs on Eugene's server

  * Include a link back to the original source.  If the source uses a
    fragment identifier, you can make a granular link; otherwise, link
    back to the whole document.

  * Write a Firefox plugin that allows you to right-click / Transclude
    content into a text widget, thus making it easy to embed
    transclusions into your blog or CMS.

  * Handle granularity finer than a node (i.e. in-node text addressing)

  * Be able to handle relative links that are just anchors: #example

  * Timeout after a period of time when trying to do a transclusion

  * One of the "Should fails" on the example page, the blockquote example,
  doesn't fail correctly

  * XHTML inclusion on Internet Explorer will not work if there
	is no space before the /> tag, such as <a name="foobar"/> --
	normalize this on the hosted server-side and add a space for
	IE.

  * Solve global warming.

  * Never lose socks again.
